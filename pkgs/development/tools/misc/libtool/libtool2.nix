      GNU libtool is a generic library support script.  Libtool hides
      the complexity of using shared libraries behind a consistent,
      portable interface.

      To use libtool, add the new generic library building commands to
      your Makefile, Makefile.in, or Makefile.am.  See the
      documentation for details.
